Out of fun and interest, I built a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin)-like instrument, being played entirely touchless with both hands. The idea was to use simple distance sensors with a digital output to do the audio synthesis on a computer. This allows for interesting and fun ways to tinker with the instrument, such as "auto-tune", different audio waveforms or multiple tones at the same time.

The hardware part is really easy â€“ two Tinkerforge [ultrasonic distance sensors](https://www.tinkerforge.com/de/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/Distance_US.html#distance-us-bricklet) are connected to a [master brick](https://www.tinkerforge.com/de/doc/Hardware/Bricks/Master_Brick.html), which directly communicates with the computer via USB. USB foot switches can be used to trigger specific effects.

On the computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi), an application manages the instrument by: 

* periodically polling sensor data;
* synthesizing smooth audio waves out of the raw data;
* sending the samples to the SDL audio mixer;
* processing additional inputs (from keyboard or foot switch) for specific effects; and
* displaying the instrument's current state in a simple graphical interface (if desired).
