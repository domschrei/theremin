# A sensor-driven, digital Theremin

![My Theremin-like instrument with its periphery](http://dominikschreiber.de/theremin/theremin-periphery-small.jpg)

Out of fun and interest, I built a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin)-like instrument, being played entirely touchless with both hands. The idea was to use simple distance sensors with a digital output to do the audio synthesis on a computer. This allows for interesting and fun ways to tinker with the instrument, such as "auto-tune", different audio waveforms or multiple tones at the same time.

Please visit the [project homepage](https://domschrei.github.io/theresa) for a demonstration, detailed instructions about how to build and use such an instrument on your own, and the general development of the project.
